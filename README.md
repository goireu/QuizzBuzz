# Game HowTo

When the game starts, everyone is allowed to buzz while the music is playing. The fastest buzzing team will have its buzzer blinking (much slower than when unconnected) and can try a guess.
If the guess is incorrect, and game is configured not to allow multiple answers, the indicator will stay lit and you can't buzz until next song.
Upon moving to next song, indicators will switch off and everyone can play again.
